Q: I'm new here. Where should I start?

A:
The Dortania guide (https://dortania.github.io/getting-started) is the best resource on hackintoshing. Everything you need to get started is there. The vast majority of video guides or other text-based guides are either outdated, not updated frequently, or their information is just plain wrong.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Can I install macOS with my NVIDIA graphics card?

A: 
Maybe, but not the latest version.
 - Ampere and Turing (GTX 16, RTX 20, 30 series) are not supported and never will be.
 - Maxwell and Pascal (GTX 745, 750, 750 Ti, GTX 900, 10 series) are supported in macOS Sierra and High Sierra, but AMD users must use High Sierra.
 - Kepler (Some GTX 600 series, Most GTX 700 series) is supported up to macOS Big Sur.
 - Reference the GPU Buyer's Guide (https://dortania.github.io/GPU-Buyers-Guide/modern-gpus/nvidia-gpu.html) for information on other cards or if you are unsure if you have a supported GTX 600, 700, or 900 series card.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Can I install macOS with my AMD graphics card?

A:
If it's recent, probably.
 - GCN 1 and 2 (R7/R9) are supported in OS X Yosemite and later, however many will require a device ID patch and many of these cards just outright do not work despite theoretically being supported. Polaris or later is highly recommended over these cards.
 - Polaris (RX 400 and 500 series) is supported in macOS Sierra and later. The RX 550 can be found in both Baffin and Lexa variants. If it is a Lexa variant, it will need a device ID patch.
 - Vega 10 and 20 GPUs are supported starting with macOS Sierra and Mojave, respectively. The Radeon VII is Vega 20.
 - Vega integrated graphics are not supported.
 - Navi 10, 12, and 14 (RX 5000 series) are supported starting with macOS Catalina.
 - Navi 21 (RX 6800 and later) is supported in macOS Big Sur (11.4) and later.
 - Navi 22 (RX 6700 XT) is not supported.
 - Navi 23 (RX 6600 and 6600 XT) is supported in macOS Monterey (12.1) and later.
 - Navi 24 (RX 6500 XT) is not supported. 
 - Reference the GPU Buyer's Guide (https://dortania.github.io/GPU-Buyers-Guide/modern-gpus/amd-gpu.html) for information on other cards.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Will macOS work with my AMD laptop?

A:
No. Their GPUs aren't compatible with macOS. Also, many people who have attempted it have reported ACPI issues, unsupported SATA controllers, etc. And to make matters worse, the lack of power management means your battery life will be terrible.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Why is my NVIDIA GPU performance worse than Windows and Linux?

A:
This is a known issue that has to do with both poor NVIDIA drivers to begin with, and the fact that the AMD OS X patches slightly reduce GPU performance.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Q: Why is my AMD GPU performance worse than Windows and Linux?

A:
This is an issue with Algrey's PAT patch (and to a much lesser extent, with Shaneee's).
Look under Kernel -> Patch in your config.plist file. Find the two patches called algrey - _mtrr_update_action fix PAT and Shaneee - _mtrr_update_action fix PAT. They should be the last two.
If you are on the TRX40 platform, delete both of these patches.
Otherwise, set the Enabled value of algrey's patch to false, and set the same key to true on Shaneee's patch.
Note that Shaneee's patch can affect HDMI/DP audio quality on some cards and does not work on NVIDIA GPUs.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Is there any way of running VMs on a macOS host?

A:
Yes, you will either need to use VirtualBox, VMware 10 or older, or Parallels Desktop 13.1.0 or older. You will of course also need virtualization enabled in your BIOS.
For VMware and Parallels, anything newer than version 10 or 13.1.0 respectively use AppleHV which is not supported on AMD CPUs.
QEMU also works, but KVM acceleration and PCI passthrough do not, so the other options are a better choice.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Why doesn't my sound work?

A:
 - USB sound will work on all systems regardless of having AppleALC or VoodooHDA. If it doesn't, follow the same instructions as for How do I fix my USB ports not working?.
 - Zen users should use AppleALC. Follow the Fixing Audio (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/update.html) guide for information on how to configure it. It will not work out of the box.
 - If no layout IDs work for you, try VoodooHDA. It does not work if injected from OpenCore on macOS 11.3 or later.
 - Bulldozer and Jaguar users should use VoodooHDA. This will work out of the box without any configuration but has slightly worse sound quality. It does not work if injected from OpenCore on macOS 11.3 or later.
 - AUX microphones don't work with AppleALC, you will need VoodooHDA or a USB DAC for these to work.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Why doesn't my PCIe/M.2 Wi-Fi work?

A:
 - Broadcom/Fenvi users should have Wi-Fi working out of the box without any kexts. If this isn't the case, either your card isn't actually supported, or there is a faulty connection somewhere. Check the Wireless Buyer's Guide (https://dortania.github.io/Wireless-Buyers-Guide/) for information on if your card is supported.
 - Intel Wi-Fi users should use itlwm (https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm). If you need Wi-Fi in the macOS Installer, use AirportItlwm and set Misc -> Security -> SecureBootModel to Default. If you want to use Continuity features such as Handoff and Universal Clipboard, install AirportItlwm as well. If you value stability and speed, use itlwm. This, however, will require you to run the HeliPort app every time you boot macOS.
 - Users of Atheros or any other vendor not listed here should reference the Wireless Buyer's Guide (https://dortania.github.io/Wireless-Buyers-Guide/) to check for support for their card.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Why doesn't my USB Wi-Fi work?

A:
First, check the manufacturer's website for macOS drivers.
If there are none, check Chris1111's Wireless-USB-Adapter repository (https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Adapter) for Catalina and older or the Wireless-USB-Big-Sur-Adapter repository (https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Big-Sur-Adapter) for Big Sur or newer to see if there is support for your dongle.
If not, you're out of luck.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Q: Can I use iMessage, Siri, FaceTime, iCloud, etc.?

A:
 - If you are installing macOS using the Dortania guide, yes. Check the Fixing iServices guide (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html) for troubleshooting steps.
 - If you are installing macOS in a VM that does not use OpenCore as its bootloader, no.
 - If you are installing macOS using a custom kernel or using a distro, no.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Where can I find drivers for my NVIDIA GPU?

A:
Check if your NVIDIA GPU is supported in the GPU Buyer's Guide (https://dortania.github.io/GPU-Buyers-Guide/modern-gpus/nvidia-gpu.html).
If it is natively supported, it will work without manually installing drivers.
If it needs the NVIDIA Web Drivers, update to the latest build of High Sierra through the App Store. If you've done this correctly, when you click on "10.13.6" in About This Mac it will say 17G14042 in parentheses, which is your build number. If not, check the App Store for another update. Once this is completed or you cannot update further, go to bot_commands and run $nvweb [your build number].
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Why doesn't my AMD GPU work?

A:
The majority of supported AMD GPUs work out of the box. If your AMD GPU is not working, check the GPU Buyer's Guide (https://dortania.github.io/GPU-Buyers-Guide/modern-gpus/amd-gpu.html) for information on anything special you may need to do to get your card working.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: How can I disable Gatekeeper?

A:
Open the Terminal and run the following command:
# spctl --master-disable
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Why doesn't this server support Clover?

A:
This is a summary of the "Why OpenCore?" page in the Dortania guide (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/why-oc.html).
 - OpenCore supports all x86(-64) versions of macOS (AMD users are limited to High Sierra and up with the AMD OS X patches, however).
 - Much less patching is done and OpenCore uses a better method of kext injection which results in better stability.
 - No need to disable SIP, and OpenCore has full support for Secure Boot, both UEFI and Apple's variant.
 - Many users in the server do not know how to troubleshoot issues with Clover as it hasn't been widely used for over 2 years.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Why doesn't this server support premade EFIs?

A:
In short, no two systems are truly alike. What works for someone else may not work for you. In addition, a lot of people making EFIs online don't know what they're doing. Although this may not be important to some people, it doesn't teach you anything. It may work in the short term, but if you ever need help with your installation, you will not know how to do basic things like edit your config, add kexts, etc. Finally, someone else's EFI may have their serial numbers still in it, and logging in with that EFI could ban one or both of your Apple IDs.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Why doesn't this server support distros?

A:
Many of the same reasons we don't support premade EFIs. In addition, though, in order for distros to successfully boot across many different systems, distro makers often put nearly every kext known to man in them, which causes instability and is just bad practice. Distros also almost never have support for iServices of any kind and it can be difficult to get GPU acceleration working on some cards. And most importantly, redistributing macOS is piracy, which is illegal.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Will my AMD iGPU work?

A:
No. The native Vega drivers currently don't know how to address system memory as video memory, as is done with these iGPUs on Windows and Linux (among many other issues). This can't be worked around easily as it's different from how it's done on Intel iGPUs. There are some who are working on these issues, but you shouldn't count on anything coming from it.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: How do I fix This version of Mac OS X is not supported on this platform?

A:
Your SMBIOS information is incorrect. For AMD, MacPro7,1 is best for Catalina and up. If you want to run High Sierra or Mojave, iMacPro1,1 is the best choice.
Do not use the -no_compat_check boot argument.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Why do my apps keep crashing?

A:
If it crashes with Illegal Instruction: 4, then it's because they are 32-bit apps, which do not work with the AMD OS X patches.

Certain apps that use Intel MKL libraries (Intel OneAPI) may crash on AMD, but it is possible to redirect calls to this API to AMD-compatible ones.
Apps like Adobe CC suite, Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Autocad, Matlab, Discord, Waves plugin set, Krisp AI, Neo Luminar and many others may be affected.
Check this thread to see update on patched apps: https://www.macos86.it/topic/5479-amd-new-applications-life/ 
Or check this thread for a tutorial on how to patch these apps yourself:
https://www.macos86.it/topic/5489-tutorial-for-patching-binaries-for-amd-hackintosh-compatibility/
Credit for this goes to @tomnic.

An app has been developed that allows you to automate the patching procedure of incompatible Intel libraries thanks to @NyaomiDev.
https://www.macos86.it/topic/5602-amd-amdfriend-for-almost-all-of-your-library-patching-needs/
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: How do I fix my USB ports not working?

A:
 - If you're on a Bulldozer or Jaguar CPU, install XLNCUSBFix.kext (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/566705665616117760/566728101292408877/XLNCUSBFix.kext.zip). It is also recommended to make a USB map with USBToolBox.
 - If you're using a Zen CPU, use USBToolBox (https://github.com/usbtoolbox/tool) to make a USB map. Make sure to read the README for that repository before using it. A map made using the Dortania manual mapping guide will work as well.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Why do the NVIDIA Web Drivers keep deselecting after rebooting?

A:
Set Misc -> Security -> SecureBootModel to Disabled. This will break AirportItlwm if you have it. In this case you would need to use itlwm instead.
Add nvda_drv_vrl=1 to your boot args.

NVIDIA Troubleshooting:
 - Uninstall Web Drivers
 - Reboot
 - Reset NVRAM in the OpenCore picker
 - Run sudo nvram nvda_drv_vrl=1 in the terminal
 - Reboot
 - Install Web Drivers
 - Reboot

If this fails:
 - Change your SMBIOS to iMac14,2, if already on iMac14,2, try iMacPro1,1
 - Install the latest security update
 - Repeat the same process
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: A new version of macOS just released. Can I install it?

A:
If the update still has the same name (e.g. Big Sur, Monterey, etc) as your current installation then most likely yes. If it is a new OS release, check the beta release discussion channel (ventura_discussion) for any issues with the new OS version.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Are beta versions of macOS supported on AMD?

A:
If by "supported" you mean bootable, then most of the time - yes. If by "supported" you mean that support is offered if you have a problem - no. In the case of completely new releases of macOS, new kernel patches must be used. Development of these patches can take time, so check in the server's beta discussion channel (ventura_discussion) to determine if the version you want to update to is bootable.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: How can I fix sleep?

A:
If on Bulldozer or Jaguar, install XLNCUSBFix.kext (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/566705665616117760/566728101292408877/XLNCUSBFix.kext.zip). Users of all CPUs should follow the same procedure as for How do I fix my USB ports not working?.
Also make sure that any unsupported GPUs are properly disabled.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: What SMBIOS should I use?

A:
You should check the Dortania guide for the most up-to-date information, however as of the time of writing:
 - MacPro7,1 should be used if running Catalina or newer
 - iMacPro1,1 should be used if running High Sierra or Mojave with a natively supported GPU or if you want to dual boot either of these OSes and a newer OS
 - iMacPro1,1 should be used if using High Sierra with a Maxwell or Pascal NVIDIA GPU, if you experience black screens with this SMBIOS, try iMac14,2
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: You guys are awesome! Where can I donate?

A:
 - First of all, thank you.
 - You can donate to AMD OS X here: (https://forum.amd-osx.com/app.php/donation/index.html).
This will go towards improving and (most importantly) hosting the forums and knowledge base. If you would like the AMD OS X Donator role, DM @Shaneee with a screenshot of your PayPal receipt.
 - Although this is not expected at all, if you would like to donate to a specific person helping you, just ask. It would be well appreciated.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: What format and partition scheme should I use?

A:
 - Partition scheme should always be GUID Partition Scheme.
 - For installing macOS from recovery, select APFS.
 - If making an installer using createinstallmedia, select Mac OS Extended (Journaled) for the drive or disk image format.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Q: When formatting my drive in Disk Utility, I don't have the option to select the partition scheme. What should I do?

A:
Select View -> Show All Devices. Then select your drive's model name and erase as normal. This will erase everything on the drive, so be careful.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Q: How do I fix my CPU showing up as Unknown or as an Intel processor in About This Mac?

A:
Install the RestrictEvents kext (https://github.com/acidanthera/restrictevents/releases).
Then set PlatformInfo -> Generic -> ProcessorType to 1537 if you have a 2-, 4-, or 6-core CPU. If you have an 8-core CPU or greater, set it to 3841.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: How can I fix the 🚫 sign followed by Still waiting for root device or my verbose screen looking garbled?

A:
This is a USB issue. Try disabling Kernel -> Quirks -> XhciPortLimit first. If on Bulldozer or Jaguar, install XLNCUSBFix.kext (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/566705665616117760/566728101292408877/XLNCUSBFix.kext.zip). If neither of these work, or if the first didn't and you have a Zen CPU, follow the instructions for How do I fix my USB ports not working?.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Q: Why is my microphone not working with AppleALC?

A:
AppleALC currently does not have microphone support on AMD CPUs. You will either need to use an Intel CPU, use VoodooHDA (this does not work on macOS 11.3 and later), or use a USB DAC or microphone.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Q: Can I install security updates/minor OS updates?

A:
Almost certainly, but if you want to be safe, or if you can't afford downtime, check general_non_support for success stories about the version in question. If on High Sierra with NVIDIA Web Drivers already installed, installing a security update will require you to reinstall the NVIDIA Web Drivers.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Q: Why can't I find NVIDIA Web Drivers for build 17G66?

A:
NVIDIA never released Web Drivers for 17G66.
Update to build 17G14042 through the App Store or through the website running the security update and then run $nvweb 17G14042 in bot_commands.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Q: macOS gets stuck on the Apple logo when I boot. What should I do?

A:
Add -v debug=0x100 keepsyms=1 to your boot args and troubleshoot according to what it gets stuck at after that.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Q: When booting, macOS gets stuck or panics on or shortly after AppleACPICPU. What should I do?

A:
Disable Above 4G Decoding in your BIOS and add npci=0x3000 to your boot args. If you do not have an option for this in your BIOS, it can be ignored. If this still does not work, remove npci=0x3000 and enable Above 4G Decoding.
If you do not have OpenCore properly configured for Resizable BAR, disable it.
Finally, make sure Booter -> Quirks -> SyncRuntimePermissions is enabled. 
As a last resort you can try updating your BIOS and trying the first two suggestions again.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: macOS gets stuck on or near IOConsoleUsers. What should I do?

A:
This indicates a GPU issue and can be caused by a number of things.
 - If you are using a device ID patch, double check that you have done it correctly.
 - If you have a GPU disabled, make sure there are no display cables plugged into it.
 - Make sure you have the WhateverGreen kext (https://github.com/acidanthera/whatevergreen/releases) installed. If none of the other solutions work, try removing WhateverGreen. 
 - If you are using the NVIDIA Web Drivers, try another video port on your GPU.
 - If you are using the NVIDIA Web Drivers, try switching your SMBIOS to iMacPro1,1. 
 - If you are using a Navi GPU, try adding the agdpmod=pikera boot argument. Note that this requires WhateverGreen. 
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: macOS gets stuck on [EB|#LOG:EXITBS:START], End RandomSeed, End SetConsoleMode, or somewhere where text starting with "EB|" is visible. What should I do?

A:
 - Make sure you have the AMD OS X kernel patches. As of the time of writing, Kernel -> Patch should report 17 children in ProperTree.
 - Make sure you have edited your CPU core count correctly into the kernel patches.
 - Make sure you have the latest version of OpenCore. 
 - Make sure Kernel -> Quirks -> ProvideCurrentCpuInfo is enabled.
 - Download the latest version of ProperTree and perform an OC Snapshot. This can sometimes fix issues with an outdated UEFI -> Drivers section if you recently updated OpenCore.
 - Remove AppleMCEReporterDisabler.kext if you are trying to run macOS 12.2.1 or below. This kext is required for macOS 12.3 and above.
 - Remove any Intel-specific VirtualSMC plugins you may have such as SMCSuperIO, SMCProcessor, or others.
 - Remove all drivers except HfsPlus and OpenRuntime. OpenCanopy or any others you know for sure are appropriate for your system may also be kept.
 - Update your BIOS. If on a 400 or 500 series chipset, disable Booter -> Quirks -> SetupVirtualMap after doing so.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: How can I transfer my EFI to my macOS drive so I don't have to boot from a USB drive anymore?

A:
Download CorpNewt's MountEFI tool (https://github.com/corpnewt/mountefi) and open it. When prompted, select the 'b' option or the number for your macOS drive. Do not select your USB drive. Copy the EFI folder from your USB drive to the EFI volume that appears in Finder.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: iMessage, iCloud, and other iServices do not work. What should I do?

A:
 - Check that your PlatformInfo -> Generic -> ROM value was generated from GenSMBIOS and is not your real MAC address.
 - Check that the rest of your SMBIOS section is correct.
 - Download Hackintool (https://github.com/headkaze/hackintool/releases) and see if there is a check mark next to your en0 network interface. If there is not, follow the "Fixing en0" section of the Fixing iServices guide (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#fixing-en0).
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Q: How can I stop macOS from giving me a notification for an invalid memory configuration?

A:
Install the RestrictEvents kext (https://github.com/acidanthera/restrictevents/releases). This is fine for the vast majority of users, but if you would like a better fix, follow the Dortania manual memory mapping guide (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/memory.html#mapping-our-memory).
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Is my CPU supported?

A:
The AMD OS X kernel patches only support specific AMD CPUs:
 - Bulldozer (Most 2011-2017 CPUs)
 - Jaguar (Most 2011-2017 CPUs)
 - Zen (Threadripper, Ryzen)
Any other processor microarchitecture, including K10, is not supported.
See here for more details on Bulldozer and Jaguar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_processors#Bulldozer_architecture;_Bulldozer,_Piledriver,_Steamroller,_Excavator_(2011–2017)

Note: Support for the Ryzen 7000 series has not been confirmed yet. 
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: How can I fix DRM? / Why don't Netflix, Apple TV+, etc. work?

A:
See this page in the Dortania guide for more info on fixing DRM: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/drm.html#testing-hardware-acceleration-and-decoding
If none of these solutions work for you, try adding unfairgva as a device property with the value <01>. If that also doesn't work, try removing WhateverGreen.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: How can I fix Cubase 11 crashing?

A:
Apply this patch: https://github.com/somestupidgirl/baios_patch
Credit for this goes to @sunneva.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: I'm confused on how to edit my kernel patches. How should I do this?

A:
Here is an example of kernel patches correctly configured for a 12-core CPU:
https://imgur.com/a/iWsxePT
The things to note here are the Replace values of each of the 3 patches. 0x0C from the image is 12 in hexadecimal.
Simply replace the second byte (1 byte is 2 characters in hexadecimal, so the second byte is the 3rd and 4th character here) of the Replace value of each of the first three patches with your CPU core count in hexadecimal.
All other bytes in the Replace values must be untouched.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Can I install macOS as a VM guest?

A:
Something to note before starting: Using a VM does not in any way solve issues with having an unsupported GPU.
Any Windows hypervisor: Ask in vm_kvm_support
QEMU on a Linux host (highly recommended): The best EFI to use (in the case of VMs, EFI sharing is fine) is this one from @Pavo: https://github.com/Pavo-IM/Hackinabox
Although it is an Unraid guide, it can be used on any Linux distro using virt-manager and QEMU.
If you just need a working EFI folder, this one is also fine: https://github.com/Pavo-IM/KVM-OpenCore
You can also use Proxmox as a free alternative to Unraid; for additional information and a guide, see here:
https://www.macos86.it/topic/2509-guide-trx40-osx-bare-metal-proxmox-setup62-1-updated-25-07-2020
If you are making your own QEMU configuration, make sure to use -cpu host,vendor=GenuineIntel instead of -cpu Penryn,… as a QEMU argument.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Discord crashes when I enter a voice call or share my screen. Is there a fix?

A:
Run $link Discord Fix in bot_commands.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: macOS doesn't show up in the OpenCore picker, but I'm sure I've done everything correctly. What should I do?

A:
 - Press space in the picker, or as a more permanent solution, disable Misc -> Boot -> HideAuxiliary. This should be the first thing you try.
 - Make sure Misc -> Security -> ScanPolicy is set to 0.
 - Make sure you have an HFS+ driver. This can either be HfsPlus.efi or OpenHfsPlus.efi, but HfsPlus.efi is recommended.
 - If on a platform that does not support RDRAND (platforms older than Zen), try HfsPlusLegacy.efi instead of HfsPlus.efi. Make sure you do not have two HFS+ drivers at the same time. 
 - Make sure you have your BaseSystem DMG and chunklist file in a folder called com.apple.recovery.boot on the root of your flash drive. Users who made an installer on macOS can ignore this.
 - Check that UEFI -> ConnectDrivers is enabled.
Note for users of macOS 10.xx:
 - UEFI -> APFS -> MinDate and MinVersion must be set to either -1 or the correct date for the version of macOS you're attempting to install.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: macOS (or the installer) boots up fine, but freezes shortly after booting. What should I do?

A:
 - Make sure Kernel -> Emulate -> DummyPowerManagement is enabled. This may also fix a panic on the AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement kext, if you experience that.
 - If you have a device ID patch for your I225-V, make sure you have the dk.e1000=0 boot arg (e1000=0 on macOS 12.3+). This forces macOS to use the I225LM kext-based driver and disables the DriverKit E1000 driver, which causes crashes on some systems.

Note for users of macOS 12.3+:
e1000=0 is required on macOS 12.3+ on systems with I225-V or I211 NICs regardless of whether you use them or not.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: How can I fix Bluetooth?

A:
In macOS Big Sur and below:
 - If using an Intel wireless card, make sure you have the IntelBluetoothFirmware and IntelBluetoothInjector kexts, which can be found here: https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/releases
 - If using a Broadcom wireless card that is not a Fenvi or AirPort card, add the AirportBrcmFixup (https://github.com/acidanthera/AirportBrcmFixup/releases) and BrcmPatchRAM (https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM) kexts. For BrcmPatchRAM, adding all of the kexts in the release will not work. Check the README for what kexts you need. Fenvi and AirPort users do not need kexts from either of these repositories.
 - Perform a USB map (see How do I fix my USB ports not working? for more details) and set your Bluetooth header's port type to 255.
 - If you have Bluetooth working on a Broadcom wireless card, but Continuity features do not work, try enabling Kernel -> Patch -> ExtendBTFeatureFlags.
In macOS Monterey:
 - If using Intel wireless, make sure you have IntelBluetoothFirmware, and that you do not have IntelBluetoothInjector.
 - If using a Broadcom wireless card that is not a Fenvi or AirPort card, add the AirportBrcmFixup (https://github.com/acidanthera/AirportBrcmFixup/releases) and BrcmPatchRAM (https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM) kexts. For BrcmPatchRAM, adding all of the kexts in the release will not work. Check the README for what kexts you need. In case the README does not make it clear, you need the BlueToolFixup kext from this repository in addition to the others mentioned. Fenvi and AirPort users do not need kexts from either of these repositories.
 - Perform a USB map (see How do I fix my USB ports not working? for more details) and set your Bluetooth header's port type to 255.
 - Do not use any wireless card injector kexts on macOS Monterey.
 - Kernel -> Patch -> ExtendBTFeatureFlags should not be used.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Q: Can I perform an in-place downgrade of macOS?

A:
Not officially, but it's fairly easy in macOS 10.15 and newer.
This method will not work for downgrading either to or from macOS 10.14 or below.
 - Download the version of macOS you want to downgrade to. This can be done either from the App Store for major versions, or from gibMacOS/installinstallmacos for minor versions.
 - Create a new APFS volume in your current APFS container. This should be done in macOS recovery to avoid macOS freezing.
 - Install the target version of macOS to this new volume. This will not erase your data.
 - After installation has completed, macOS will ask you if you want to import your data from your data volume. Select yes.
 - After verifying that your data is intact, you can delete the volume for your previous version of macOS. This should also be done from macOS recovery.

Q: macOS won't boot anymore! How can I access my EFI partition from Windows?

A:
Open diskpart.
Run these commands in diskpart:
 - list disk
 - select disk x (where x is your macOS disk)
 - list partition
 - select partition x (where x is the partition marked as System)
 - assign letter z (z can be substituted for a drive letter of your choice)
 - exit
Download Explorer++. (https://explorerplusplus.com/download)
Run Explorer++ as an administrator.
You should now be able to access your EFI partition.
If you need to open your OpenCore configuration file in ProperTree, run it as an administrator.

Q: macOS spams com.apple.xpc.launchd on macOS 12.3+ and doesn't continue. What should I do?

A:
Add the AppleMCEReporterDisabler kext. (https://files.amd-osx.com/AppleMCEReporterDisabler.kext.zip)
If you boot both a version of macOS above 12.3 and a version below 12.3 on the same machine, set the kext's MinKernel value to 21.4.0.

Q: Can I install macOS Ventura?

A:
It is possible, but expect to find issues and bugs.
As always, we offer no support for issues encountered on beta versions of macOS.
The latest commit of the AMD OS X patches supports macOS Ventura betas 1 and 2.
In addition to this, you will need:
 - OpenCore 0.8.2 or later
 - The latest release of all of your kexts
Both of these are absolutely required.
For existing Ventura users who have used the previous guidance:
 - Enable Booter -> Quirks -> AvoidRuntimeDefrag
 - Enable Kernel -> Emulate -> DummyPowermanagement

Q: Some apps don't work after disabling AMFI and SIP on macOS Monterey. Is there a way to fix this?

A:
Add ipc_control_port_options=0 to your boot args.

Q: Does Sidecar work on AMD?

A:
Previously it barely worked, but some discoveries have been made in this area recently.
You will need:
 - An iMac19,x or iMac20,x SMBIOS
 - Acidanthera's FeatureUnlock kext (https://github.com/acidanthera/FeatureUnlock)
After this, run these commands:
$ defaults write com.apple.AppleGVA gvaForceAMDKE -boolean yes
$ defaults write com.apple.sidecar.display LowLatency -bool True
$ defaults write com.apple.sidecar.display MinBitrate -int 250000000
$ defaults write com.apple.sidecar.display MaxBitrate -int 250000000

You may find it beneficial to play around with the minimum and maximum bitrate values to find what is most stable for you.
